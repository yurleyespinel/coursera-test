<div class="burger col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sd-6"><p class="pizza hotdog">Pizza</p> Pizza is a baked flatbread dough, usually round in shape, made from wheat flour, salt, water and yeast, topped with tomato sauce and cheese.

Its recipe is extremely simple and includes few and genuine ingredients: wheat flour, fresh brewer's yeast, water and salt.
Once the dough is obtained, it must be fermented: the longer it is left, the more digestible it will be. The dough is carefully worked to shape and cut it and, after other fermentation phases, it is spread and the ingredients are added on top to put it in the wood oven.
It is very important to spread the pizza not using the rolling pin, but with your hands to ensure a much better result in terms of fluffiness and final consistency of the dough. Last but not least, the oven must be turned on long before it reaches its maximum temperature.
